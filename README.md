Explanation of Features
Multiple Device Control:

Lights: Controlled by the user’s focus level.
Fan: Adjusted based on relaxation levels.
Smart Lock: Locks/unlocks the door based on intensity of brain activity.
Curtains: Open/close based on calmness levels.
Thermostat: Activates when overall brain activity crosses a threshold.
Signal Thresholds:
Adjust the thresholds for each brain signal (e.g., focus > 70) based on your EEG device’s sensitivity and your needs.

Modular Functions:
Each smart device has its own control function for easy customization and debugging.

Scalability:
You can easily add more devices by defining new GPIO pins and writing additional control functions.

Requirements
Raspberry Pi with GPIO pins.
EEG headset (e.g., Muse, OpenBCI).
Relay modules for high-voltage appliances.
Smart plugs for easy integration with non-smart devices.
Laptop or smartphone for monitoring EEG signals (if necessary).
Future Enhancements
Voice and Gesture Integration: Add voice or gesture controls as an alternative input.
Mobile App Control: Develop a mobile app for real-time control and monitoring.
AI Learning: Use machine learning to adapt device controls based on user habits.
