## What Controls What?

| **Brainwave Activity** | **Controlled Device**     | **Action**                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Focus Level             | Light                    | Turn ON/OFF                   |
| Relaxation Level        | Fan                      | Turn ON/OFF                   |
| Intensity Level         | Door Lock               | Lock/Unlock                   |
| Calmness Level          | Curtain                 | Open/Close                    |
| Overall Brain Activity  | Thermostat              | Turn ON/OFF                   |
